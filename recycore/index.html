					<p>
						Among the many projects at <a  href="https://www.sincubator.com/indexen.html"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Sincubator</a>, Recycore is the one in which I enjoyed creative control from the beginning. Recycore sought to deploy recycling boxes around locations such as electronics stores, while the recycled products could be resold for scraps which provides the revenue stream for the company. Although Recycore failed to move forward due to financial viability issues, I see it as the project that best reflects my design style and capability.

						<br><br>

						For the Recycore project, my work included logo design, infographics, website design and development (Responsive Web Experience), and the design of a printable collection box for recycling.

						Logo & Graphic Design
					</h2>
					<blockquote>
						The logo design and colour template of Recycore combines visual elements from the brand’s environmental and tech philosophy. The logo design was created by including the familiar recycling symbol embracing green plants and the “wire and plug”, which brings about a digital, modern feel to the design while representing the business objective. For the colour template, I have chosen various shades of green and contrasting red and yellow to reflect modern, clean aesthetics and accentuate the environmental message of the business. The creation of the logo was done via Illustrator & Photoshop.

						Collection Box Design
					</h2>



					<blockquote>
						The collection boxes form the core of Recycore’s business model. The plan was to deploy the boxes outside partnering locations, such as shopping centres, electronics stores, schools, libraries, etc. It was designed to be an easy way to retrieve unwanted electronic waste, especially cables for cellphones, tablets and computers. More than just points of collection, the boxes would also serve as an advertisement to Recycore itself and an educational tool to raise awareness of the impact of electronic waste. The design was adopted to reflect the above-mentioned aspects while being consistent with the brand messaging.

					The work on the project began with a brainstorming session between the development and marketing teams. I created a flow chart for the website to help the teams better visualize the content placement and points of interaction. As the next step, I used Figma to create a high-fidelity mockup to illustrate the look and feel for further discussion between the teams. I took the lead as the primary front-end developer. 

					<br><br>The website was developed with HTML & CSS with Bootstrap.

					In order to showcase the industrial process, technology and business case for Recycore, the teams determined that the best way forward was to produce a range of assets with infographics at its core for use on the website. Again, I took the lead in the creation of relevant infographics using existing research and business plan, which clearly illustrated how Recycore was envisioned to function. The final product was intended for the official website as well as media distribution, so two versions of the infographics - one stationary and the other dynamic - were produced using HTML and CSS.
