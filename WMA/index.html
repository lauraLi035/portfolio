					<p>
						WMA Montessori is one of the largest daycares (0-6 yrs) in Metro Vancouver. Located in a newly-developed residential tower in the bustling Metrotown area in the centre of Burnaby, WMA offers an enrolment capacity of 200 students with its top-of-the-line facility, environment and equipment. WMA further boasts an education philosophy true to its Montessori origin, which is meticulously maintained by its 20+ locally certified staff. Taking an extra step from the average daycare experience, WMA provides fun language, maths, cultural and social activities to broaden the learning horizon of its students.
						<br><br>

						Even before the completion of their facility, the owners of WMA urgently required enhanced aesthetic and SEO solutions to improve the effectiveness of their original website. In short, the web redesign & redevelopment project brought a 280% increase in traffic, while earning 500+ high-quality leads in the first two months since coming online. The project also streamlined the engagement process by building an embedded registration and automatic response system. The main tools of the project were WordPress plugins: CSS Hero, Elementor and Fluent Forms. The aesthetic elements were also massively improved with new visual designs that truly captured the spirit of the business.

						Persona
					</h2>
					<blockquote>
						The project began with relatively limited direction from the client: they provided an early PPT for demonstration purposes, in addition to a few CG renderings of the facility. In order to initiate the project on solid footing, in-depth discussions were held with the client to create a persona - the typical intended audience of the website. Through researching the application and informal interviews with potential parents, we successfully created two distinct personas representative of our target audience. 
						<br><br>
						This step was critical for determining what to develop - web functionality, SEO content, visual design, etc. - it was a list of dos and don’ts, as well as a roadmap for the project

						User Flow Map 
						<br>& Low-Fidelity Wireframes
					</h2>
					<blockquote>
						The next step is to analyze potential parents’ feedback to clarify their needs while browsing WMA’s website. On this basis, a user flow map was created to communicate the bottlenecks and opportunities with the client, who were presented with crystal-clear rather than muddled decisions on design choices and respective pros and cons.
						<br><br>
						From the discussions, I followed up with a low-fidelity wireframe for fast iterations, which was visually intuitive and made the back-and-forth with the client that much easier!

				<blockquote>
					The final step before putting the project into action is the creation of single-page high-fidelity mockups. I used Adobe Illustrator to construct a single-page digital wireframe interface based on the refinements and improvements on a version of the website created in Wordpress. 
					<br><br>
					These finalized mockups (in terms of visuals) gave a solid product for the client to review and approve upon and closely resemble the final product.
